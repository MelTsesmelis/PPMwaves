# PPMwaves

```
   In this project user gives an number. This number transfer to binary, check if the digits of this binary is divisible by 3
   and make parts of this pattern of bits per 3. Encode this with PPM-8 so for 3bits we have a 8-bits PPM to replace it with.
   And based on this pattern of bits create a PPM graph using python
